        My name is Maryam Bouh and I am currently in second year electrical engineering doing ILS. Over the past few
        years, I have developed an interest in obtaining computing skills. It first started out by networking and
        meeting people on discord that made me realize the importance of the digital world. Then, I slowly started
        learning how to code simple languages such as Python, Html, and CSS. I chose engineering because I wanted to
        use and build on my soft skills in a professional manner. However, choosing the stream of engineering was
        hard, due to the fact that I had a lot of options. Finally, I ended up picking electrical over software
        because I found that despite my love for programming, embedded design is the path I want to go in the future.
        One of the projects that I am most proud of was building my own PC. I was always into playing games however I
        never really had a good PC to run it on. Therefore, during the beginning of covid I ended up saving money and
        buying parts for my PC. It allowed me to research and figure out more about PC parts. This in return helped me
        gain a better appreciation for the classes I have taken this semester.
