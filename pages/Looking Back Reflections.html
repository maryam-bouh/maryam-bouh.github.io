    <h2> Looking Back Reflections </h2>
    Looking back at my reflection, one that I wanted to delve into was about learning strategies. Due to being online
    for well over 2 years, at the beginning of covid I did not adjust very well to online
    learning. It took using a bunch of online softwares and taking my first few online tests to learn new study habits.
    One learning strategy that worked with me last semester is rewatching lectures to help me understand the content,
    if I didn't get it the first time. I will ensure to maintain this by implementing the same learning strategy this
    semester. One area that I could have improved on last semester is procrastination, I would not do my work on time.
    This is habit is one I will try to actively work on through the following semesters. I did find that at the
    beginning of the semester I was not the best at time management. However closer to the end of the semester I was
    able to pan ahead of time since there were multiple deadlines that
    overlapped each other. This in return made me less stressed and perform better overall.
    Another reflection I wanted to write about was on teamwork and Diversity. I learned alot about team work during ILS
    and am extremely grateful I was a part of this experience. In terms of my personal identity and how I can leverage
    my strengths within engineering teamwork activities. Is being trustworthy. I can leverage this quality as a strength
    because when working with a group you always need a group member that is
    trustworthy in order to succeed. For example, when I was given the circuit to take home my group entrusted all of
    the parts with me to work on. In return while I was working on the project one of the capacitors blew up. So instead
    of hiding it from my group I first told them what happened and went out of my way to get another
    capacitor and fix the circuit in the way that was needed.
