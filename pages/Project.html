    <h2> Pomodoro Timer </h2>

    1. Creating a pomodoro timer. The "Pomodoro Method" is a simple method to balance focus with deliberate breaks it
    consists of a <i>25 minute
      study session</i> and a buzzer sound will go off and you will begin the <i>5 minute schedule break</i>. To get
    ideal results you would repeat the process 3 more times then take a long break after the 4th. We built this device
    with the idea of helping students improve their study habits by committing to this
    technique of work. Since we are engineering students and experience procrastination, the opportunity to create a
    tool that would
    help ourselves as well as others was a chance that we couldnâ€™t miss.

  <div class="card"> Our pomodoro timer was created by conconnecting the wall output to the barrel jack. Taking this 12v
    in from our wall plug we step this voltage down to 5v to act as our Vdd for our components. Our circuit begins with
    our AVR, this is powered on and awaiting a signal to begin counting. Once the signal has been given it will begin to
    increment until a specified timer value is reached. Once this timer is reached a reset call is made for our second
    timer before executing a reset to the screen, the
    second timer will begin to increment until it's timer value at which counter 1 will reset. An alarm will sound, and
    the screen will reset with the loop.
