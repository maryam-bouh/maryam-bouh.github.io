    <p>
      Through the integrated learning stream in my second year at the University of Calgary. I was given
      the opportunity of developing a project using an approach to project management and software development. In this
      semester we had to make a project that incorporated all the concepts learned in the 4 classes we took (ENCM 369,
      ENEL 327, ENEL 361, ENEL 343).

    <strong>Biggest Takeaway!</strong>

    <p>
      One of the biggest takeaways I got from this course was teamwork. Prior to taking this course I could not imagine
      how big of a difference it would be to have a good group. I was blessed to have such an amazing group that worked
      well together. We made a discord server and communicated very well there. When it came to assigning tasks everyone
      would step up and take the task they are the most comfortable with. Furthermore, when in disagreement we would
      often find ourselves looking for solutions rather than making a huge deal out of it.
    </p>

    <strong>Some things I learned about design and entrepreneurship was that it takes consistency and failure to make a
      good product!</strong>

    <p> At first it was very hard to come up with an innovative product which was within the guidelines of the class.
      However, with a great group and many hours of brainstorming we came up with an alarm clock that caters towards
      people that are hard of hearing. When we initially came up with this idea we had a hard time trying to make our
      product innovative. Furthermore, allowing us to dive into potential features that can be added to our alarm clock.
      We then came up with an idea that caters towards students being our users.
