      In this class we took a deeper look into signals and transformations. We were able to analyze signals both in the
      frequency and the time domain using fourier series and fourier
      transforms. One of the biggest highlights in this class was the teaching project. Our group researched about the
      different types of modulation. The concept of Modulation is extremely important in the communication industry.
      Modulation is the process of altering a transmitted carrier in order to convey information. It provides an
      efficient
      way to shift speech signals to a desired frequency Furthermore, it was very interesting figuring out how AM and FM
      radio are constructed. I personally researched amplitude modulation or AM radio. Amplitude modulation is a
      modulation technique which is used to convey information as we change the amplitude of
      the carrier.

    <strong>Some common applications of AM includes:</strong>

    <ul>
      <li>Broadcasting (AM radio)</li>
      <li>Avionics (Vor, ILS)</li>
      <li>EMC testing</li>

      This teaching project helped me gain insight on the greater topics of signals. Furthermore, allowing me to become
      an
      ‘expert’ on this content. Which was ideally the end goal for this project.

      <strong>In my project I delved into:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>the fourier transforms of AM</li>
        <li>Some advantages and disadvantages of AM</li>
        <li>Modulation index</li>
        <li>The 3 different frequencies</li>
        <li>guided example problems that delve into AM related questions</li>
    </p>
