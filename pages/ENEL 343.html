    <p>
      ENEL 343 was another exciting class I took this semester! By performing hands-on labs and projects I was able to
      grasp many of the important concepts learned in this class. One particular lab that I took an interest in was
      building a speaker. We built and designed the speaker using a TLV4112 op-amp.
    </p>

    <strong>Some of the skills I gained from doing this lab is:</strong>

    <ul>
      <li>Reading and being able to use datasheets</li>
      <li>Incorrect placement of wiring and or capacitors allows for inaccurate results</li>
      <li>Working in a team provided beneficial results</li>
      <li>Being able to communicate with you team helped aid in the results</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This speaker circuit was very beneficial in our final project. We were able to incorporate speakers into the sound
      system of the alarm clock making it a prime feature. Making it with adjustable sound (using a potentiometer), and
      a
      silent feature which catered towards people that are hard of hearing.
