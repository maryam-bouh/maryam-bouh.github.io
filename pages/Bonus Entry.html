    <strong>Last year during the pandemic I built my very own PC!</strong>

    <p>I collected all the parts I needed such as the GPU, CPU, CPU fan, SSD, Hard Drive, motherboard, etc. I was able
      to
      customize all the pieces to my liking and paid a good price for a quality pc.In terms of my degree, I was able to
      explore the ideas around electrical engineering whilst working on this project. It allowed me to explore more
      about
      the CPU,which in return made me enjoy the content learned in 369. Another class this project made me enjoy was
      361.
      Furthermore, in 361 we had a lab about the importance of heat transfer which I learned about when applying thermal
      paste onto my CPU fan when building my PC.
