  <p>ENCM 369 was an exciting class I took this semester! It was very well structured, and I felt as if I gained the most experience from this class. In this class I learned about micro controllers and designed projects based on concepts we learned in the class.

  <strong>Skills</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Programing blinking LEDs</li>
    <li>Reading from data sheets</li>
    <li>Using Pickit Programmers</li>
    <li>Programming Microchips</li>
  </ul>

    The labs were also well rounded allowing us to do work beyond what was expected from us, with the help of the AVR
    data sheet.<br>
    When I was first introduced to micro controllers I was unable to wrap my head around how the AVR128DB28 worked, and
    was totally oblivious to the amount of projects it can handle.<br> However, despite the coding being very hard it
    made a lot of sense at the end.<br>
    <br>A particular interest in a lab was where I designed an Analog to Digital convertor to sample an analog input
    voltage level and convert it to a number.<br> We then used The ADC to turn on different LEDs depending on the
    voltage level that was applied to pin PD2 on the AVR.
